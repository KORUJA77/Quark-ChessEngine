TO DO LIST
============
Here is a centralised to do list that I can add to as I see/think of things.
Note that this file isn't for ideas or features but instead for more real,
pressing problems.

- Fix the BasePiece isvalidmove method. Currently it is super hackish and goes
against Python Koans. I would like it if all of the chess pieces inherited from
it without any overwritting of the base class. Perhaps make a public "call" that
decides what private call to use?

- Clean up the isvalidmove methods that overwrite the BasePiece class to make
them cleaner, assuming the previous point is abandoned.

- Clean up RookPiece in piece_tests.py so that it follows the same style as the
other piece's unittests.
