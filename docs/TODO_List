TO DO LIST
============
Here is a centralised to do list that I can add to as I see/think of things.
Note that this file isn't for ideas or features but instead for more real,
pressing problems.

- Clean up RookPiece in piece_tests.py so that it follows the same style as the
other piece's unittests.

- Write extensive tests for the chess board classes.
They will be the ones being used non-stop and copping the worst of the program.
I want to make them robust as possible before I try to expose them to an engine.

- Make meaningful errors in core.py and chessboard.py.
Lots of errors are raised as assertion errors, which means nothing. These need
to be altered so that the errors have some meaning attached to them, even if that
means to create new exceptions.

- Finish writing up testing suites.
Before writing any more code I need to finish writing up the tests on the code
developed so far.
