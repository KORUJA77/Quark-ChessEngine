TO DO LIST
============
Here is a centralised to do list that I can add to as I see/think of things.
Note that this file isn't for ideas or features but instead for more real,
pressing problems.

- Clean up RookPiece in piece_tests.py so that it follows the same style as the
other piece's unittests.

- Write extensive tests for the chess board classes.
They will be the ones being used non-stop and copping the worst of the program.
I want to make them robust as possible before I try to expose them to an engine.
