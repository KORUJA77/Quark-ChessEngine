# NOTE:
# ================
# This file is currently a work in progress. The original chessboard.py file has
# become overly bloated and is detrimental to the moral of the project. This new
# script is aimed at taking only the methods that pertain to the UI and GUI,
# while separating the other components into their own scrips
