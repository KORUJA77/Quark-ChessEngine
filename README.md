# Quantum Chess Engine

So what exactly is the Quantum Chess Engine? It is an engine written completely in python that is able (or at least will be one day) to play chess. It was written as a hobby project to practice programming. So far there are no packages required.

## Examples

There is nothing here yet.

## Why bother? Isn't there already lots of chess engines?

Why bother doing anything? Seriously, this engine was written by some recent physics graduates in order to practice using python. We can not guarantee that it works, nor that it will ever be finished.

## Installation

There is nothing here yet.

## API Reference

Currently there is no API, but it will be added as the project progresses further.

## Tests

The code is currently untested.
